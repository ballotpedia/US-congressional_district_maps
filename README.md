This is a repository of base64 encoded HTML maps of every US
Congressional District as well as geoJSON files for all districts. I used the [US Census
Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_cds.html) to
download the Congressional Districts for the current Congress (at this
time the 115th Congress). I then used [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to make
the maps and [geojson.io](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson.io) to make the [geoJSON](http://geojson.org/) files.
